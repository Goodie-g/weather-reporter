# WEATHER REPORTER

## Description
This is a weather forecast app built to show current and upcoming weather conditions.

## Description
This was built in an attempt to understand how weather forecast apps work and as well as provide me with a better understanding of several JS concepts like, the DOM, API's etc.

## Quick Start
The app is straight forward, when first opened it will check for your location and retrieve weather data about the location. You can also look up weather data from different places as well using the search feature on top of the screen.

## Usage
The app also allows you to see the forecast of up to 3 days in the future. as well as extra details of a specific time or day.

## Contributing
You can contribute by bringing up any issues you encountered or fork the repository and open a pull request to the `main` branch.
